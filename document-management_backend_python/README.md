# PDF Document Q&A API

This project provides a simple Flask application that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions based on their content. The application uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach to process the PDFs and respond to queries.

## Features

- Upload multiple PDF documents.
- Ask questions about the uploaded documents.
- Retrieve relevant references from the documents.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask
- Document RAG library (ensure this is installed and configured)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your API key**:
   - Ensure you have your OpenAI API key set up. You can either set it in your environment or directly in your code as needed.

## Usage

1. **Run the Flask application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The application will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2. **Upload PDF Documents**:
   Use the `/upload` endpoint to upload PDF files.
   
   Example using `curl`:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -F 'documents=@path/to/your/document1.pdf' -F 'documents=@path/to/your/document2.pdf' http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload
   ```

3. **Ask a Question**:
   Use the `/ask` endpoint to ask questions about the uploaded documents.

   Example using `curl`:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question": "What is Alice\'s cat\'s name?"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/ask
   ```
